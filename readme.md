# Animation Development Brief
 
We have included a video render of an animation, all assets have been provided. What we would like from your submission:
> 1. A web page developed with SCSS (compiled to CSS) & HTML5, which reflects the video animation scene.
> 2. Include all your source files, we our evaluating on how you structure your web page and maintain your stylesheets.
> 3. The final task is to create a branch, push your work into the branch and send a merge request to the submissions branch for review.

#### What would we like to see?
 -  HTML â€“ Clean semantic code, use BEM methodology for naming conventions
 -  SCSS - Usage of key frame animations, directives, variables and a grid system
-   Delivery of animation - Add your own touch to the animations, you can choose to replicate the animations in the video or improve on them with your own style.  Mostly we are looking to see how you would structure a web document and maintain a style sheet, animation secondary.
-   Bonus Points for: JavaScript / jQuery - function that activates animations
    -    If the function activate is executed the animations will begin.
    -    If the function deactivate is executed the animations will stop.
    -    If no click functionality enabled a looping animation is the expected behaviour.

## Content 
Container should be 1920px width & 1080px height, with overflow: hidden style applied. Elements should not be absolutely positioned, we'd like to see a grid system applied. Tip: Use transform: <transform-function> for animations.
